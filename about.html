                    <h2>The Pivot That Changed Everything</h2>
                    <p>
                        My path to technology wasn't traditional. I started at the University of Calgary with dreams of becoming a doctor, earning my Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences between 2015 and 2020. But during my studies, something unexpected happened—I discovered the power of data and coding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What began as curiosity about how data could solve problems in healthcare evolved into a passion for technology itself. Instead of pursuing medical school, I made the pivotal decision to redirect my career toward data science and technology. It wasn't an easy choice, but it was the right one.
                    </p>

                    <h2>From Pre-Med to Tech Pioneer</h2>
                    <p>
                        The transition wasn't just about learning new skills—it was about finding where I truly belonged. I threw myself into the Calgary tech ecosystem, participating in hackathons, joining bootcamps, and connecting with innovators who shared my passion for using technology to create meaningful change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've been fortunate to work with incredible organizations like the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (AMII), Cybera Inc., and now as a Business Analyst at Halo Health. Each experience has reinforced that my pivot into tech was more than a career change—it was finding my calling.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Community and Giving Back</h2>
                    <p>
                        Technology isn't just about code and data—it's about people and community. That's why I serve on the boards of Sikh Youth Calgary and the Mazboot Youth Initiative. I want to help others navigate their own career transitions and show them that it's never too late to pivot toward your passion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through my blog on Medium, podcast appearances, and mentorship opportunities on Topmate, I share the lessons I've learned about career transitions, data science, and finding success after rejection. If my story can help even one person feel less alone in their journey, it's worth it.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm passionate about data engineering, machine learning, and creating tools that solve real-world problems. Whether it's developing computer vision models at Cybera, analyzing social finance at Innovate Calgary, or teaching young minds at MakerKids, I'm driven by the impact technology can have on people's lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Data Science at the University of Calgary while working as a Data Science Intern at Nutrien Inc, I'm constantly learning and growing. The tech industry moves fast, and I love that about it—there's always something new to explore, build, and optimize.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Beyond the Screen</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you'll find me engaging with Calgary's startup ecosystem, participating in hackathons, or creating content for my YouTube channel where I share project walkthroughs and tech insights. I'm also a brand ambassador for CITI and an alumnus of the Cybera Electron cohort and NeuroNexus competition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey proves that your undergraduate degree doesn't have to define your career. With determination, community support, and a willingness to learn, you can pivot into any field that excites you. From biological sciences to business analytics, from lab benches to data dashboards—it's been quite the adventure, and I'm just getting started.
                    </p>
